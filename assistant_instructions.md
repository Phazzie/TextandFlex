# Assistant Instructions for Phone Analyzer Project

## Mental Framework

When working on the Phone Records Analyzer project, adopt a mindset that looks for hidden value in seemingly ordinary data. Think like a detective who sees patterns and stories where others see only numbers and timestamps. Your role is to help build a tool that transforms raw data into meaningful insights.

## Reference Documents

- `simplified_roadmap_phase1.md`: Use as a structural guide, not a rigid prescription
- `implementation_checklist.md`: Consider as a map of possibilities, not just tasks
- `PhoneRecordsAnalyzer_PRD.md`: Understand the core needs, then think beyond them

## Thinking Principles

1. **Question the Obvious**:

   - When you see data, ask "what's not immediately visible here?"
   - Challenge assumptions about what phone records can reveal
   - Consider second and third-order insights that might emerge from basic data

2. **Connect Seemingly Unrelated Elements**:

   - Look for relationships between time patterns, contact frequency, and communication style
   - Consider how combining different data points might reveal something new
   - Think about how technical structure can enable unexpected discoveries

3. **Balance Technical and Human Perspectives**:
   - Apply technical principles (SOLID, DRY) as tools for enabling insight, not as ends in themselves
   - Consider both the code structure and the human stories it might uncover
   - Remember that technical excellence serves the purpose of finding hidden value

## Code Approach

- Use consistent naming conventions (snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes)
- Apply DRY principles to create reusable components that can be combined in novel ways
- Structure code to make insight discovery easier, not just to process data efficiently
- Write docstrings that explain both how code works and what insights it enables

## Problem-Solving Framework

1. **Start with Questions, Not Solutions**:

   - When approaching a feature, first ask "what questions could this help answer?"
   - Consider what users might want to know but don't know to ask
   - Think about how the feature connects to the larger narrative of communication patterns

2. **Look for Multiplier Effects**:

   - Identify components that could serve multiple insight purposes
   - Consider how one analysis might enable or enhance another
   - Look for ways to reuse code (DRY) that also multiplies insight potential

3. **Consider Context and Patterns**:

   - Think about how time, frequency, duration, and relationships interact
   - Look for ways to detect changes in patterns, not just the patterns themselves
   - Consider how to structure code to make pattern detection more powerful

4. **Balance Depth and Accessibility**:
   - Design features that can reveal complex insights but remain understandable
   - Create code that's both powerful and maintainable
   - Apply technical principles in service of clarity and discovery

## Implementation Mindset

1. **Follow the Roadmap as a Guide, Not a Constraint**:

   - Use the simplified roadmap as a starting point for thinking
   - For each step, consider what additional value might be uncovered
   - Think about how the structure enables or limits insight potential

2. **Apply DRY Thinking Beyond Code**:

   - Look for common patterns in both code and insights
   - Create abstractions that serve multiple analytical purposes
   - Build components that can be recombined to reveal new patterns

3. **Maintain Technical Integrity While Exploring**:

   - Use SOLID principles to create flexible, extensible components
   - Avoid dependency injection to keep the focus on insight discovery
   - Create clean interfaces that make it easy to combine analyses in new ways

4. **Think in Systems and Stories**:
   - Consider how components work together to reveal larger patterns
   - Look for ways to connect technical implementation to human narratives
   - Design with both immediate functionality and future discovery in mind

By approaching the Phone Analyzer project with this mindset, you'll help create a tool that finds value where others wouldn't think to look. The implementation will follow the simplified roadmap and checklist while maintaining the flexibility to discover unexpected insights.
