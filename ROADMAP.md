# Qlix Project Roadmap

_Last updated: April 24, 2025_

This roadmap consolidates all previous plans and roadmaps into a single, actionable checklist. It covers the full project lifecycle: setup, core features, advanced analysis, and future enhancements. Use this as the single source of truth for project status and planning.

---

## Phase 1: Core MVP

### Project Setup

- [x] Establish directory structure and Python packaging
- [x] Set up virtual environment and requirements
- [x] Configure logging and configuration management
- [x] Create README and .gitignore

### Data Parsing

- [x] Implement Excel file validation and parsing (`src/data_layer/excel_parser.py`)
- [x] Add data cleaning and normalization (`src/utils/data_cleaner.py`)
- [x] Robust error handling for malformed data
- [x] Unit tests for parsing and cleaning

### Data Repository

- [x] Implement data storage and management (`src/data_layer/repository.py`)
- [x] Add querying and persistence
- [x] Unit tests for repository

### Basic Analysis

- [x] Implement core statistics (`src/analysis_layer/basic_statistics.py`)
- [x] Add contact and time-based analysis
- [x] Implement simple pattern detection (`src/analysis_layer/pattern_detector.py`)
- [x] Unit tests for analysis modules

---

## Phase 2: Enhanced Analysis & Advanced Features

### Advanced Pattern Detection

- [x] Extend pattern detection for gaps, overlaps, and response times
- [x] Implement `gap_detector.py`, `overlap_analyzer.py`, `response_analyzer.py`
- [x] Integrate with main pattern detector
- [x] Unit tests for advanced pattern modules

### Data Integrity & Consistency

- [x] Implement dataset comparison and deleted message detection
- [x] Add consistency analysis and data validation framework
- [x] Unit tests for integrity modules

### Longitudinal Analysis

- [x] Implement trend analysis, contact evolution, and seasonality detection
- [x] Register longitudinal components with dependency container
- [x] Unit tests for longitudinal analysis

---

## Phase 3: Call Records & Unified Analysis

### Call Record Integration

- [x] Extend parser and data model for call records
- [x] Implement call-specific analysis (duration, frequency, patterns)
- [x] Integrate call and text analysis in unified framework
- [x] Unit tests for call analysis

---

## ML Architecture & Integration

- [x] Implement MLModelService and exception hierarchy
- [x] Register ML components with dependency container
- [x] Integrate ML models with pattern detector and longitudinal analysis
- [x] Add feature flag support and caching
- [x] Document ML architecture and integration
- [x] Unit and integration tests for ML components

---

## Test-First & Quality

- [x] Write tests before implementation for all new features
- [x] Focus on edge cases and error handling
- [x] Maintain high test coverage
- [x] Refactor safely with tests

---

## Documentation & Maintenance

- [x] Consolidate all roadmaps into this file
- [x] Maintain a single changelog (`changelog.md`)
- [x] Keep documentation up to date with code changes
- [x] Follow the checklist in `implementation-checklist.md`

---

## Next Steps / In Progress

- [ ] Ongoing: Refine advanced pattern detection and ML-powered insights
- [ ] Ongoing: Performance optimization and code cleanup
- [ ] Ongoing: User feedback and UX improvements
- [ ] Ongoing: Documentation and onboarding improvements
