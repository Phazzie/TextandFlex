# GUI Implementation Changelog

## April 22, 2025

### Added

- Complete interface contracts and documentation in `interface_contracts.md`:
  - Detailed abstract base classes for all controllers (FileControllerInterface, AnalysisControllerInterface, AppControllerInterface)
  - Comprehensive signal/slot connection examples with code samples
  - Concrete data model specifications (FileModel, AnalysisResult)
  - Mock implementations for all controllers to enable parallel UI development
  - Testing examples using pytest-qt
- Added linking to core phone analyzer analysis classes from `phone_analyzer/changelog.md` to enable GUI integration with existing functionality:
  - ContactAnalyzer for contact relationship analysis
  - TimeAnalyzer for time pattern detection
  - BasicStatisticsAnalyzer for core statistics
  - AnalysisResult classes for standardized result formatting

### Fixed

- Integration plan missing concrete interface definitions between Plan A (core) and Plan B (UI)
- Signal/slot connection documentation lacked specific code examples
- Data model contracts were too high-level without implementation details
- Missing linkage between new GUI models and existing analysis layer

### Updated

- Interface definitions now include proper type hints and docstrings
- Mock controllers implement complete testing scenarios for UI development
- Expanded testing examples to cover both unit and integration tests
- Connected AnalysisController interface with existing analysis layer classes
